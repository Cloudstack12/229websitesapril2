                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Brand voice is essentially the personality a small business exudes on their website, social media, and other marketing assets. Small businesses looking to differentiate themselves through an engaging and instantly recognizable voice should be intentional about pinpointing something unique and reflective of who they are as a business and then integrating it into their small business websites - from written copy to visual elements like graphics and imagery. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Put your brand voice front and center when using hashtags on social media, because it can have a powerful effect on how people see you. Incorporating branded hashtags into your content helps create visibility and continuity in your posts, while also communicating important elements of your company’s ethos or purpose to anyone who comes across newly-created content. Having an identifiable hashtag also encourages interaction between other users as they recognize the tag, come together through shared interest, and engage with each other around topics relevant to what you stand for.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Laughter is the best medicine and social media keeps us supplied with plenty of it. Witty and funny posts have a way of breaking through the noise online and engaging viewers with their lightheartedness. Whether it's a sarcastic quip or a side-splitting meme, social media users just can't resist a clever joke. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Witty and funny hashtags are powerful tools for getting your message out there on social media. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a business owner, or a web developer or social media manager, having creative and humorous hashtags in your arsenal can help you make impactful connections with other professionals and potential customers. You don’t have to be witty or funny yourself - the key is to use existing clever tags that will captivate people who search for those terms online.

                        <p>
                            As small business owners, it's important to stay connected with our clientele. One of the most efficient ways to accomplish this is through small business websites. Another way is through social media.

                            Are you using hashtags for your business on social media? Make sure that you are talking to your ideal audience. With so much noise on social media, it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle and fail to reach your target audience. The trick is to make sure that you understand who they are and what words or phrases best represent them. That's why keeping your audience in mind when using hashtags is so important—it helps draw their attention and establish a connection with them far more effectively than just randomly hoping something resonates.

                            Hashtags have quickly become the most widely used tool for social media marketing. They can help draw attention to a post, spark conversations, and add interest to an otherwise bland topic. But that doesn't mean you should get too carried away when using them. Hashtags can be a powerful tool to reach potential customers if used correctly. But don't let your hashtag game get too crazy - crossing the line from effective to excessive can have serious consequences. Remember, each platform has a recommended number on how many hashtags to use.
